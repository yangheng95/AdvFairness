Target:com.gpl.rpg.AndorsTrail	Review:Good game Well  but the game too depends on grinding system to level up and gain gold. Doing quests do give you more exp  but most of those quests require high level to complete  such as killing high level monsters  or etc. So we need to grind weak monsters first  gaining exp and purchasing items with gold.

Target:com.github.wdkapps.fillup	Review:This is a GREAT app. I have been using it for YEARS already on all my vehicles. Very user friendly and easy to use. With the stats  plots and logs  it shows you everything. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star rating  is the fact that it does not auto backup to either Google drive or any cloud storage for that matter. This means that after putting fuel in my vehicles  I have to back it up every time. I did once all my vehicles data  due to not backing it up  and then my phone broke  and had no way to retrieve the data. If there is any way at all that it can be auto back-upped  that would make this app PERFECT in all respects. Even if I have to pay for the app then  it will be worth it.	$LABEL$1

Target:net.nurik.roman.muzei	Review:Not sure if this is an issue just for me  but I have this app on 2 devices and they both cycle through subreddits regularly about every 10 minutes while on WiFi. I've found that over time the app stats taking up quite a lot of storage and I had to go into the phone settings to clear the data from the app. The app got close to 800mb large. Not that big of a deal since it can be solved by clearing the data  still slightly annoying to need to do that every so often. Love the app otherwise!	$LABEL$1

Target:com.plusonelabs.calendar	Review:Good  but. . . Nice looks. But still has niggly problems. Deleting an event from the calendar does cause the widget to update itself. Needs to be scrolled down and refreshed for it to work. Deleting the event when there is no network means we have to deselect the calendar and reselect it for that item to go. All this testing was done after adding new items to the """"""""phone calendar"""""""".""	$LABEL$0
Target:com.plusonelabs.calendar	Review:The calendar widget works great! Except it doesn't sync with my Google calendar. Some things are only on the Google calendar.

This is a good app so you don't have to stream them from YouTube  etc. I would have given 5 stars if the """"""""""""""""static / record-skipping"""""""""""""""" noise didn't exist when the background loops as a couple others have pointed out. It is not too big of a problem though  just one part I see that could be improved.""	$LABEL$1

Target:com.ihunda.android.binauralbeat	Review:I've never felt anything like it This app is amazing  everything on it works for me and I've never had any problem with it. Last night I tried the Schumann Resonance for the first time  and around 5-6 minutes in I started having vague visions and at around 8 I started hearing distorted laughter and odd voices  the visions got very strange and every time I blinked I saw static. By far the strangest experience I've ever had.	$LABEL$1

Target:net.somethingdreadful.MAL	Review:Great design but a few bugs I'm running into the same bugs as derek chan where my anime list shows instead of the manga list. Seems to consistently happen if I view an anime or manga's details by tapping on it in my list and then go back to my list. Also happens if I go to my phone's home screen and reopen the app from my recent apps list. I'm running KitKat on a Maxx HD. I hope this help you track down the bug.	$LABEL$1

Target:naman14.timber	Review:Good start. Improvements primary necessity not aesthetics. Great looking app. A little too good for its own good perhaps. 1. Struggles with animations( option to turn them off available but still no one likes to turn animation off that too when it looks so beautiful). 2. Lacks equiliser  but still a problem that can be overcome easily. 3. Couldn't find a widget which was surprising. There's a lot of scope for this app to be a great hit!

Target:com.amaze.filemanager	Review:Why the frequent updates? Don't you have a test device there before deploying an update???	$LABEL$0
Target:com.amaze.filemanager	Review:Thanks for the fast and lightweight manager. It can grow to take place of the ES of the past. Switched from ES because recently  it has become a spam and bloatware heavy app  and the top in battery draining list. Some bugs/suggestions: 1. Copy paste and cut paste notification stays on forever. Therefore next operation in queue won't start. 2. Have to set the default home tabs  each time I open the app. 3. Dual toolbar top (static) and bottom  would have been great. 4. The top ui bar should occupy less space  and be static with address  tabs  three line menu switch  etc. The dynamic style of it hinders easy copy pasting  directory switching etc 5. Grid view is not as comfortable as ES  cannot get the same experience even after adjusting the no of rows	$LABEL$0
Target:com.amaze.filemanager	Review:I have been looking hard for a replacement for ES file explorer since I have been having root issues with it on the dreaded systemless root and after trying several different root file explorers  I am finally going with this one.

Target:ohi.andre.consolelauncher	Review:It's a new thing to work with. You have to remember a few commands but that's fine. The only problem I faced was that I couldn't change the username in the settings.txt file. No matter how much changed it kept getting over written.	$LABEL$1

Target:ohi.andre.consolelauncher	Review:Wow! I installed without expecting much  or that it would be a keeper  but I love it! So far I think it's better than a touch launcher as I don't have to hunt through icons for an app. One thing I'd like to see is argument auto complete not clearing the preceding command  e.g. if I type (or auto complete) help and start typing an argument e.g. 'ap' (for 'apps') then when I auto complete 'apps' I don't want it to clear the help command - 'help ap' currently becomes 'apps' after auto complete.	$LABEL$1

Target:uk.org.ngo.squeezer	Review:Excellent app Does exactly what it's supposed to do. I think the notification system should be a separate service though  that can be disabled from the settings.

Target:org.mysociety.FixMyStreet	Review:Not the best way to report potholes A far quicker response can be got by reporting potholes directly on the County Council's website because then it goes straight to the Contractor rather than just on a list for a busy council officer to look at when he has time.	$LABEL$0
Target:org.mysociety.FixMyStreet	Review:Great idea but... Works great for reporting problems but the app itself has problems. The back button doesn't work  there's no menu  no way to exit  and it often doesn't download map tiles. If the UK was sorted it would be so much better	$LABEL$0

Target:org.tasks	Review:This is a great app  but they're trying the well worn path of ""make the app as ugly as possible then charge people so it stops hurting their eyes"". Have developers forgotten that there was premium version of this app in the past  then they said thanks for the money  it's now going to be free for everyone and we're taking away the features you paid for? Themes should be free to anyone who ALREADY BOUGHT PREMIUM FEATURES. Apparently dev responded to this review but I can't read it!!	$LABEL$0

I entered my primary departure points and now when I head to BART I can open the app and right there it shows me  in real time  when the next train is arriving.

Target:com.dougkeen.bart	Review:Hands down the best BART app Super stable  accurate  fast  and functional. Nearly perfect for commuters. I've been using it daily for well over a year. Thank you for creating it! My two suggestions to reach perfection: (1) have a special mode to sort/add departure favorites because it is easy to accidentally swipe one away  (2) allow for different font sizes on favorites list so more/less fit on the screen at once.	$LABEL$1
Target:dev.ukanth.ufirewall	Review:Great app Just brilliant. A much needed tool to keep data usage under control. Well done and thanks dev.	$LABEL$1
Target:dev.ukanth.ufirewall	Review:Works fine for blocking unwanted """"""""""""""""conventional"""""""""""""""" traffic. Custom scripts can be useful to block annoying stuff from ES File Explorer for example. However AFWall+ cannot give 100% guarantee to block all traffic. Voice recognition can get through the net and run successfully (as shown in account audio activity) while all outbound traffic is disabled by AFWall+. So at least when changing rules/profile some services such as Google Services can get through no matter what.""	$LABEL$0

Target:de.danoeh.antennapod	Review:Simply (literally) the best! With the latest update this player leaves all the others in the dust. Paid and unpaid. No esoteric resource hungry featured. Incredibly stable. Good looking working perfectly for a podcast addict like me. This is my most used app. It's playing 6-12 hours a day! It never ever fails and with the Sonic player built in it sounds great even through my high end ear buds. I really want to pay for this app! For me it's worth double digit dollars Try it.

Target:de.danoeh.antennapod	Review:Good  but one major problem The widget part of the app barely works.

Otherwise a wonderful app.	$LABEL$1

Target:de.danoeh.antennapod	Review:Was decent... but now dead. This app has been maybe slightly less frustrating than most podcast apps I've tried. Sounds funny  but there are too many options (for me). I want simplicity and a clean UI without too much hassle or tweaking. **As of 12/24/16 it no longer works. At. All.** I tap to open... it closes immediately. Reported issue. Everything it states last update fixed is actually what's happening NOW. (Wasnt before.)

Target:com.android.keepass	Review:Can not change database I ca not change the databas or it might be an usability issue. Anyway it sucks.	$LABEL$0
Target:com.android.keepass	Review:This is an essential suite for any user -- desktop & mobile. I use Dropbox to keep one file updated for all platforms. THIS version has two major failings however. The first is that while the desktop version(s) use a file: DATABASE.KDB as the default  this mobile version insists on looking for a file called KEEPASS.KDB instead.. The second is the slavish devotion to a SANS-SERIF font! Without serifs you cannot distinguish a lower case L from an upper case i! And if your password uses either one  you're in for some grief. I suppose a third issues is that no matter how often you use this  it NEVER remembers where the password file is  or what it's called. Having this (and other things) employ the fingerprint security would be a huge plus  but not deal-breaking.	$LABEL$0

Target:com.android.keepass	Review:First thoughts. Seems OK  and database can be held on SD which is essential for syncing between devices with Syncthing (in a user-defined location too  which makes things very easy). BUT how do you delete a group - there seems to be no option to do this?	$LABEL$0

I will return it to a 5 star rating as soon as I can actually play it again.	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Love but I have an issue I have solved many many puzzles but my rating has not been raised in over a year...what's up with that?	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:I've been using Shortyz for year  and this app is great for doing the NYT Crossword. However  it still doesn't handle rebus puzzles  which is only an occasional issue  but it makes it tough to do them when they show up. Also  I would love to see it keep cumulative stats (best time for each day  etc.)	$LABEL$1
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Overhaul Thanks for adding the crosswords that were unavailable for so long. I've been playing this for years  and will definitely keep this app  however  I see know reason for you to keep adding the same old NY Times puzzle from Nov. 1998. Every Monday  there it is!	$LABEL$1
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Please expand keyboard Please allow for number and character entries. Otherwise  truly appreciate the app  using it almost daily.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:But... I'm giving 4 stars but would be giving 5 if this latest revision didn't do something weird on the """"""""""""""""Clues"""""""""""""""" view. The Clues bar is super zoomed in and I have to scroll right and left to see how long the word is. Nothing I do fixes it. I'm on Android S6.""	$LABEL$1
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Requires multiple touches I love the choice of puzzles and overall design of the app. I give it 3 stars because I often have tap a box 4-6+ times for the app to switch to that box. It happened on my old phone and is doing the same thing on my new phone. No other apps or phone functions have that problem  so it's not a phone issue.	$LABEL$0

Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:S6 issue? Love this app  but since upgrading to S6 you cannot tap on the letterboxes to relocate cursor... Actually you can  you just need to tap 4 or 5 times for it to take.	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Good but the UI isn't for me Navigating the puzzle was clunky at times. I'm not a fan of the general layout of the puzzle/keyboard. The settings are nice and give you the ability to customize.	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Great app  but ... While the new version is nice  I prefer the old version because it was a dark theme and the new one is white and bright which is a horrible battery drain and difficult to read because of the lack of contrast ... I also HATE the new keyboard! Give us the option of a dark mode and I'll up my rating.	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Needs to show us our own stats The software keeps our stats somewhere internally so it can report to Google Play games. But there is no way for us to see them. Give us an interface that shows us our own stats  please. Also  at least give us some clue as to what the last 5 Google play games achievements are. Finally  if we are using show errors mode  find a way that mis-types don't count as hinted boxes. And if we start a puzzle in show errors mode  how about giving us a warning box to switch it back to hide errors before starting.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:some lame changes You can no longer choose 2 skip filled boxes in a clue which makes it very annoying.. re: no longer seeing incorrect boxes highlighted  u have to change it while a puzzle is open. The swipe to delete or archive action sucks..if you added a 3rd option of nothing it would be fine. I just lost 1/2 a completed puzzle cuz the phone thought I wanted to delete it. Change those back and I'll give it at least a 4. PS Signed: Not a Cave Woman lol	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Buggy It could be amazing  but it has a few annoying quirks - the swipe to delete feature! What the heck! Half the time it opens the puzzle. Also  it's impossible to delete puzzles in the archives	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Better than Crossword Puzzles 123CW... This crossword puzzle app DOES work with my KitKat OS  while 123CW failed to display an onscreen keyboard or work with my bluetooth Zagg Keyboard. Good landscape display on my Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 also. The layout is just fine  and not hard on my eyes. Also  it pulls the Washington Post puzzles and others for free  while 123CW makes them premium content. Best app. Hope this helps.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:I like the crossword puzzle program but After the update I can't delete puzzles... Fixable? I think the older program had a more efficient use of space.

Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:S-pen and finger don't work on Galaxy Note 10.1 This app worked beautifully on the original note. I now have the 2014 version. Sometimes I have to tap a box/cell 3-4 times before I get a response. Also  the grid doesn't automatically zoom to fill the screen.	$LABEL$0
Target:com.totsp.crossword.shortyz	Review:Luv it. One of the best xword apps I've found. Two minor issues - everyday it loads the same puzzle from People  for some reason  and then sometimes it loads NYT puzzles from months or years ago so they are frequently ones that I've already done.	$LABEL$1

Target:org.telegram.messenger	Review:Thanks for the theme options!! I'm happy about the dark theme in the latest update and no problems loading the app so far. I was hoping if it's possible to feature flat  round cornered speech bubble options with customizable color options for the bubbles and the text in the future? Not sure how that would affect how the app functions but it's something of a visual preference for me.	$LABEL$1

Target:org.telegram.messenger	Review:The only thing keeping from being 5 stars is the lack of a way to tell when the other person has received the message. It probably isn't something you want to hear  but I like how WhatsApp handled the read receipts. Maybe implement something similar? Currently  I can't tell when they've received the message  only when they've read it.	$LABEL$1

I would like to use this widget on my phone  but I will probably end up tossing it off my phone because it is too hard to set up (and I'm not one to give up that easy).

Also unable to delete a way point on map view so couldn't even switch plan on the fly. I want this app to work  I hate apple and also hate foreflights inability to work with the Android market. Flight plan go has major issues as well but does better in my opinion. If I could combine these two I'd pay the same subscription fee I had with foreflight for years. This one is not user friendly unfortunately. FPG is more user friendly yet doesn't allow touching map to bring up terminal area info and plates for an airport you tapped  but this one does  yet editing and navigating the UI is awful. Frustrating. Make a product that competes with foreflight functionality and I will PAY.	$LABEL$0

This is incredibly frustrating as I had my phone in a case and I had to take it out of the case to switch the screen back on. * When in """"""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""" mode and using the offline maps if you switch out of the app (i.e. using the task switch button in Android) and back into the app the maps completely disappear  the route is still visible (i.e. the lines) but everything else is gone. The only way I've found to fix this is to stop """"""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""" and start it all over again! I found this issue due to the previously mentioned issue where the screen would turn off. When I switched the screen back on and went back into the app the maps were gone. I would appreciate if the developer(s) of the app could fix this as the bugs mentioned above make navigation using """"""""""""""""LiveRide"""""""""""""""" a real painful experience.""	$LABEL$0

This option changes the controls from touchpad-like to direct input. I personally prefer this mode.

Even when adding an additional external memory  there is still no option to place this waste of data and space to free up my internal memory. I hypothesized that the ones behind this app only will continue to make this app larger by each update so our devices only have Google play and Google play alone. They obviously do not heed the numerous complaints of their customers. Perhaps they are the very people that do the updates of Skype as well. Adding useless features that no one really bothers with and not focusing on making the app become more functional their users at its core.	$LABEL$0

Target:com.fsck.k9	Review:Outstanding  and getting better Update (Dec 2015). Still by far the best email client. /// (2013) I have used K9 for several years for my non-gmail account. The current official version is 4.409  and it is excellent. However  today I installed the latest version posted at the K9 Mail developer's site  4.512  and additional improvements make this email client stand out by some distance. Even in comparison with Gmail. Wow!	$LABEL$1

My local storage has capacity 4gb only and with all apps installed included emails my free space is cca 300mb - result is that whenever i want to update any app  i have to do cleaning cache and other data. Installing k-9 app on local storage is off course OK. The concern is email data only. Anyway  very good email client""	$LABEL$1

Target:com.fsck.k9	Review:4.5 Star. So far seems to be good. I greatly appreciate being able to export settings  & receipts  & many other features. I can only suggest 3 things. 1. Allow messages to be date grouped in the Inbox with header title being a date; like the way the default /stock email app does it on Samsung Galaxy phones. 2. Allow to only download headers; again like default email app. 3. Allow emails to Not be synced/stored on phone. Especially when setup as an IMAP connection.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.fsck.k9	Review:Been using it since the very beginning of Android and while I've often looked around  this still remains the best email app for Android. Everything available for free  highly customizable and it's open source to top it off. Easy 5/5.	$LABEL$1

Target:com.farmerbb.taskbar	Review:It works! Good job. Works as advertised. Using 6p(nougat 7.1) with freeform mode and it's been a good experience so far. UI could be better  hence a star less.	$LABEL$1

Target:com.farmerbb.taskbar	Review:Thanks for a nice  clean  small and open-source app made for improving system usability. Please change version number when updating app. Please add to your todo list: 1. Ability to reorder pinned items manually. 2. Option to reduce icon size of recent items  so more can fit without scroll. 3. Show the search box for any device. 4. (impossible?) Resize app's windows so taskbar don't overlap them  like the real taskbar in Windows.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.farmerbb.taskbar	Review:Clearly fantastic. Works even on the highly restricted and boring miui environment. Btw the windows mode works only for play store. I would love If I get to see it supporting more apps on miui. Please make it possible. Overall it felt brilliant for using this kind of app in miui	$LABEL$1
Target:com.farmerbb.taskbar	Review:Thank you.Good Job.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.mendhak.gpslogger	Review:Altitude offset I'm constantly getting around 50m offset of the altitide. Is it possible to get altitude correction feature?	$LABEL$1
Target:com.mendhak.gpslogger	Review:good info but email faulty. UPDATE: Using S7 Edge now and email works perfectly. My rating now 5 stars Samsung S3: provides gps locations as expected and uploads to google-drive/docs but email appears to only work for the test msgs  not actual logs. I can workaround the email fault with google-drive but would prefer the email function to actually work (that would make the 5th star).	$LABEL$1
Target:com.mendhak.gpslogger	Review:No file created Installed this app and tried logging data. When I got home could find no data recorded. There was no GPSLogger folder. The front screen mentions a path of /storage/sdcard0/Android/data/com.mendhak.gpslogger/files but this does not exist either. I am stumped.	$LABEL$1
Target:com.mendhak.gpslogger	Review:Awesome This GPS logger is the best I've used. Runs in the background flawlessly  consumes minimal battery and resources  tracks every parameter I can think of  and it's a clean simple interface. Well Done!	$LABEL$1
